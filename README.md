# Learning with AI — Smart Home with ESP32-C6 & Raspberry Pi 4

Short repo for hands-on learning and examples to build Zigbee-capable smart home devices.

## Learning topics
- Software: ESP-IDF development for ESP32‑C6 (Zigbee stack, firmware, flashing)
- Hardware: Building devices + Raspberry Pi 4 integration (wiring, power, Pi as coordinator/gateway)

Goals
- Working ESP32‑C6 example(s) with Zigbee endpoints and a Pi-based coordinator.
- Concise docs, wiring notes, and reproducible steps.
