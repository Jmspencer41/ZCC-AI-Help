Best option for DHT22:
Use Adafruit_DHT - it's specifically designed for DHT sensors and will save you from dealing with DHT22's finicky single-wire protocol.

Summary:

DHT22 + LD2410C combination: Use both libraries

Adafruit_DHT for temperature/humidity
pyserial + custom class for LD2410C presence sensor
gpiozero: Not suitable for either sensor type

For your project, I'd recommend:

Then create two separate sensor reader classes - one using Adafruit for DHT22, one using pyserial for LD2410C.
